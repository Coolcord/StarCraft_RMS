## About StarCraft Random Map Selector

 StarCraft Random Map Selector (also known as RMS) is a tool that simply copies a random StarCraft 1 map into a folder. It is suggested to run RMS every time before StarCraft is launched. This can be accomplished easily with a .bat file. Running RMS allows StarCraft players to easily access new random(s) map every time they launch the game.
